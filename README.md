# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# week5-lab1
Created a new React project for Week 5 Lab 1, including the implementation of Hello and Bye components in separate files. Established a Git repository for version control, linked it to a remote GitHub repository, and successfully pushed the project to GitHub to ensure accessibility and collaboration.
