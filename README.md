# week5-lab1
Created a new React project for Week 5 Lab 1, including the implementation of Hello and Bye components in separate files. Established a Git repository for version control, linked it to a remote GitHub repository, and successfully pushed the project to GitHub to ensure accessibility and collaboration.
